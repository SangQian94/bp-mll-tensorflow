# bp-mll-tensorflow
Efficient (vectorized) implementation of the BP-MLL loss function in TensorFlow (bp_mll.py). Requirements: Python3, Numpy and TensorFlow.

There is also an alternative implementation using the Keras API in bp_mll_keras.py, which can be used with any backend supported by Keras.

Check bp_mll_test.py and bp_mll_test_keras.py for an example.
